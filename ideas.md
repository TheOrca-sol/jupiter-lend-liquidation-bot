  🏆 My Recommendation: Start with Option 1 + 2

  Build the "Jupiter Trading Automation Suite" starting with:

  Phase 1 (Month 1-2):

  1. ✅ Liquidation Bot (done!)
  2. Web dashboard for monitoring
  3. JupLend risk analytics
  4. Telegram/Discord community

  Phase 2 (Month 3-4):

  5. DCA automation bot
  6. Limit order manager
  7. Premium subscription launch
  8. Marketing & community growth

  Phase 3 (Month 5-6):

  9. Arbitrage bot
  10. Perps trading bot
  11. White-label offering
  12. Apply for Jupiter grant/contributor rewards

  💡 Why This Strategy Works:

  ✅ Immediate value - Liquidation bot already working
  ✅ Multiple revenue streams - Subscriptions + performance fees + referrals
  ✅ Scalable - Start solo, grow to team
  ✅ Community-aligned - Helps users earn/save money
  ✅ Jupiter-friendly - Uses their APIs, promotes ecosystem
  ✅ Contributor rewards - Eligible for JUP grants/rewards

  💰 Revenue Potential:

  Conservative estimates:
  - 100 users × $49/mo = $4,900/mo (Year 1)
  - 500 users × $79/mo = $39,500/mo (Year 2)
    - Performance fees + API referrals + white-label

  🎁 Jupiter Contributor Program:

  Jupiter rewards contributors through:
  - Working Group Grants (like the 4.5M JUP governance allocation)
  - Community rewards for valuable tools
  - Revenue sharing on some API integrations
  - Marketing support for quality projects
